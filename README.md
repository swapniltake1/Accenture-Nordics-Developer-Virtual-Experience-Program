#  <h1>Accenture Nordics Developer Virtual Experience Program</h1>
<p>
Part 1:

You are joining an ongoing project, replacing a front-end developer who unexpectedly became long-term ill while developing the “create account” page for a new mobile application. To enter this role, you need to get familiar with the previously written code, for which you have been informed that some of the written functions already have related unit tests. You decide that a good approach is to initially run these tests, but after running them you realize that some of them fail. This concludes that one, or several, functions don’t work as intended. Your first task is therefore to edit the code to ensure that the functions work as they should. 

Note: The tests are correct, the error are caused by bugs in the main file. So, it is only the main.py that should be modified, not the testrunner file. 

Part 2:

After successfully running the implemented tests you notice two recently added functions. The front-end developer has created a draft of unit tests for these, in the file testrunner.py, but have left them uncompleted.

<p>
Remove the comment notation (''' ''') and change the "assert False" part of each test to finish them and ensure that the functions work as explained in their respective comments. If bugs are found, correct these. 

In this task you will use the website repl.it. This allows you to use a pre-setup environment, so you do not have to worry about what OS and python versions you are using. If you do not have a repl account, go to repl.it and create one. Review section 4 'Resources to help you with the task' below for further information on getting started.

Repl.it instructions

Login to repl.it  
Click here to open repl environment 
Click FORK to be able to run and make changes in the code 
Click on the “run” button in the top middle. This will install and update things in repl and then the tests will run. 
Find and solve the bug(s) in main.py, re-run the program to all tests pass.  
In the end of main.py see the functions for question 2 and write the tests in testrunner.py
